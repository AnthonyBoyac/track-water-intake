## GOAL
- **Track your daily water intake in a *fun* way** : [view website here!](https://www.nomumizu.com)

## Why does it exist?
- Drinking water is important, but I forget to do it sometimes... most of the time... everyday. There needs to be a fun way to track daily water intake, and existing apps failed to bring out that entertainment. I need to have some level of fun involved to keep using this sort of app, so I designed one :)

## What to know about this project
### Notes:
- unit of measurement is in **ounces** for nice rounded inputs
- mobile support coming in future updates
- app is designed using *localStorage,* so users need to use the **same device and browser** if they want their daily activity tracked, more so for achievements (yes, there are achievements)

### Steps
Users can:
1. decide their daily reset time based on their wakeup time
2. pick their daily target goal (at least 50)
    - there's a recommended amount of water needed, so users have an easier time picking a goal
3. add presets
    - ie. I use the same water bottle everyday to drink water and I know how much liquid it can hold, so I would add it as a preset (in ounces)
        - **name**: everyday water bottle
        - **size**: 26
4. click `Drink` to increase today's water intake
5. click `Undo` to reduce today's water intake from the last input
6. change audio volume when clicking `Drink`

### Finally
- I added animations to play every increment of today's water intake relative to the target goal
- Because I'm an *achievement hunter,* I added a few achievements :D
